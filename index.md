My name is Konstantinos Psaroulakis, and I am a Software Engineer and ML Engineer @ Signal Processing Laboratory of Foundation of Research and Technology (FORTH). 
My current role focuses on the research of a wildlife audio surveillance system, to detect both human or animal activities on real field audio recordings. (Relevant languages/frameworks/libs that I currently use: Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, librosa, numpy, matplotlib, pandas, tkinter, PyQt)

I see myself as a curious and knowledge-thrived person who takes initiative and pushes himself to his limits, always chasing new challenges and trying to catch up with the advancements of technology in my sectors of interest.

Apart from my continuous need to advance and update my machine learning and software development skills, I spend a lot of time studying finance and investing concepts as well as blockchain and algorithmic trading.

The past years, supplementary to my main occupation, I have worked as a flute tutor in conservatories and as a flute performer in gigs. Music is another passion of mine..a second path that I always follow in parallel with my main path.

You can find out more about me on [my online CV]({{"/_pages/cv_page/" | relative_url}})	 and some of my past and current projects either on my [github profile](https://github.com/konpsar/) or on my [portfolio]({{ "/portfolio" | relative_url }}) section on this page.
