My name is Konstantinos Psaroulakis, and I am on a 9-month leave to fulfil my mandatory military service for Greek Army. Up to June 2021, I had a Software Engineer and ML Engineer role @ Signal Processing Laboratory of Foundation of Research and Technology (FORTH). 
My responsibilities were:

 - The research and the development of a wildlife audio event detection system, to detect both human or animal activities on real field audio recordings. (Relevant languages/frameworks/libs: Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, librosa, numpy, matplotlib, pandas, seaborn)
- The development of a command line interface and a graphical user interface of open source tools for chainsaw and cough detection. (Relevant languages/frameworks/libs: Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, librosa, numpy, matplotlib, pandas, seaborn, tkinter, PyQt5)
- The maintenance of a server running a Restful web service for cough detection, built with Java/MongoDB. (Relevant languages/frameworks/libs: Java, Docker, MongoDB, Tomcat, Unix)

I am a curiosity-driven fast-learner who always tries to keep updated and learn new concepts about artificial intelligence, software development, finance, investing and psychology.


Music is a parallel path I had always been following alongside with my main career. I play the flute and have worked as a flute tutor at conservatories (and occasionally I play the guitar and sing).
