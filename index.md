My name is Konstantinos Psaroulakis, and I am a Software Engineer and ML Engineer @ Signal Processing Laboratory of Foundation of Research and Technology (FORTH). 

I am a curiosity-driven fast-learner who always tries to keep updated and learn new concepts about artificial intelligence, software development, finance, investing blockchain, algorithmic trading and psychology.
Music is a parallel path I had always been following alongside with my main career. I play the flute (and occasionally I play the guitar and sing).


Want to learn more about be? Please check [About me]({{"/about" | relative_url}}) section or [my online CV]({{"/_pages/cv_page/" | relative_url}}).
You can also find some of my past and current projects either on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/konpsar/) or on my [Portfolio]({{ "/portfolio" | relative_url }}) section on this page.
