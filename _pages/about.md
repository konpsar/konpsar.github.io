My name is Konstantinos Psaroulakis, and I am a Software Engineer and ML Engineer @ Signal Processing Laboratory of Foundation of Research and Technology (FORTH). 

My current role focuses on the research of a wildlife audio surveillance system, to detect both human or animal activities on real field audio recordings. (Relevant languages/frameworks/libs that I currently use: Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, librosa, numpy, matplotlib, pandas, tkinter, PyQt)

#### Personality 

I see myself as a curiosity-driven and knowledge-thrived person who takes initiative and pushes himself to his limits, always chasing new challenges and trying to catch up with the advancements of technology in my sectors of interest.

Apart from my continuous need to advance and update my machine learning and software development skills, I spend a lot of time studying finance and investing concepts as well as blockchain, algorithmic trading, psychology.
