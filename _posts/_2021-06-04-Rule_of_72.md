## Rule of 72

There are times, where everyone wants to calculate the number of years required to double invested money at a given fixed annual interest rate. 
Of course one can make this calculation with spreadsheet programs, but to quickly find an approximate value, the Rule of 72 comes handy in mental calculations. Rule of 72 is a way of calculating fast the number of years is takes for an investment or your money to double.
​	  
$$ \text{Years to Double} = \frac{\text{Interest Rate}}{72} $$
​

For example, someone heards of an interesting investment oppurtunity with a fixed interest rate of 9%. Given this fact, he'd like to know in how many years his investment will be doubled in value. 
Using the Rule of 72, it can be calculated with just a division that he would need 72/9 = 8 years to double his invested amount.

An important notice is that Rule of 72 can be applied effectively to a specific range of rates (6-10%). However, there is a way to make Rule of 72 more flexible by adding or subtracting 1 from 72 every 3 points the interest rate diverges from the 8% threshold. For continuous compounding, the rule of 69 would be more suitable for any rate, since the actual calculation depends on $$ln(2)$$ which is approximate 69.3%. Since daily compounding is close enough
and contin
For continuous compounding, the Rule of 69 gives accurate results for any rate. This is because ln(2) is about 69.3%; see derivation below. Since daily compounding is close enough to continuous compounding, for most purposes 69, 69.3 or 70 are better than 72 for daily compounding. 

Considering the fact that Rule of 72 is a simplification of a more complex logarithmic equation, we can't rely on this rule when precise calculations are needed. However,it can be used for fast mental calculations when needed, as a pretty close approximation.
The actual calculation that one can use to be precise is the following:

## Derivation
$$ Τ_d = \frac{ln(2)}{ln(1+\frac{1}{100})}\neq \frac{72}{r} $$ <br>
$$T_d$$: Time to double <br>
$$ln$$ Natural log function <br>
$$r$$  Compunded interest rate per period <br>

Let's check the power of the rule of 72:
T = ln(2)/ln(1+10%) = 8.043 years
which is pretty close to 72/9 = 8 that rule of 72 gives.


However, If we try to calculate with rule of 72 when the interest diverges much from 8%, we can see that the formula needs readjustment.
$$T = ln(2)/ln(1+4%) = 17.673 \text{years} \neq 18 = \frac{72}{4} $$
$$T = ln(2)/ln(1+24%) = 3.22 years \neq 3 = \frac{72}{24}$$
However, with the following readjustment, the rule of..(not) 72 is more accurate:
(24-8)/3 = 16/3 = 5.3 = 5 --> Rule of 72+5 = 77 --> 77/24 = 3.21
(4-8)/3 = -4/3 = -1.3 = -1 --> Rule of 72-1 = 71 --> 71/4 = 17.75


## History
Luca Pacioli (1445–1514), an italian Mathematician and collaborator of Leonardo DaVinci had a reference to the rule in the Summa de arithmetica (Venice, 1494. Fol. 181, n. 44).Even though he presents the rule as an estimation of the doubling time of an investment, he does not derive or explain the rule. Thus its assumed that the rule predates Pacioli by some time. <sup>[3](#refs)</sup>


Key takeways about the Rule of 72:
- It can be used as a way to calculate fast the number of years it would take for an investment to double your money (only for compound interest)
- It applies to compounded interest rates and is reasonably accurate for interest rates that fall in the range of 6% and 10%. However it can be easily readjusted to work pretty accurately for interest out of that range.
- It can be applied to anything that increases exponentially, such as GDP or inflation; it can also indicate the long-term effect of annual fees on an investment's growth.
