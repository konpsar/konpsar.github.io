My name is Konstantinos Psaroulakis, and I am on a leave to fulfil my obligatory military service for Greek Army. Up to June 2021, I had a Software Engineer and ML Engineer role @ Signal Processing Laboratory of Foundation of Research and Technology (FORTH). 
My responsibilities were:
	- The research and the of a wildlife audio event detection system, to detect both human or animal activities on real field audio recordings. (Relevant languages/frameworks/libs: Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, librosa, numpy, matplotlib, pandas, seaborn)
	- The development of a command line interface and a graphical user interface of open source tools for chainsaw and cough detection. (Relevant languages/frameworks/libs: Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, librosa, numpy, matplotlib, pandas, seaborn, tkinter, PyQt5)
	- The maintenance of a server running a Restful web service for cough detection, built with Java/MongoDB. (Relevant languages/frameworks/libs: Java, Docker, MongoDB, Tomcat, Unix)

I see myself as a curious and knowledge-thrived person who takes initiative and pushes himself to his limits, always chasing new challenges and trying to catch up with the advancements of technology in my sectors of interest.

Apart from my continuous need to advance and update my machine learning and software development skills, I spend a lot of time studying finance and investing concepts as well as blockchain and algorithmic trading.

The past years, supplementary to my main occupation, I have worked as a flute tutor in conservatories and as a flute performer in gigs. Music is another passion of mine..a second path that I always follow in parallel with my main path.
